One more boring Monday at the bank.

Adam Gray works in a bank. He doesn't like his job and he doesn't like Mr Smith, his boss.

I must go. I don't want to be late for work.

Every day is the same. Nothing exciting ever happens to me.

Morning, Adam.
Morning, Mrs B.

Now she says, 'Your horoscope for today.'

Your horoscope for today.
Libra. Do something different today.

It's not true.
Thanks, Mrs B. Bye.

Usually, I go left…
Do something different today.

He goes right and walks through the park.

Suddenly…

What's happening?
Help!
Stop that!

Come on. Run!
Who's he?
We don't know.
Cut!

At the same time…

Nobody move!
Give us the money!
Come on! We want to leave. The police are coming!
Thump!
Ouch!

Come on! Move!
Sorry.

I know that voice, I think.

Police. Help!

Screech

Quick! Run, before they see us.

Stop! I don't need your help.

You don't understand. My name is Serena Silver. I'm an actor.

And the men with you. Who are they?

Actors.

There's no money in the rucksack. Just newspaper. Look.

At the same time…

How much money have we got?
Lots.
I want to see.

But they get a big surprise.

What's this?
This is newspaper! Where's our money?
This is bad!
That man has our rucksack!
And our money!
The dirty thief!
We must get our money back.

This isn't newspaper.
I don't understand anything.

Suddenly…

Are those men actors?
No, they're not. And that gun is real. Run!

Why are you waiting? Move!
Stop, you dirty thieves. Or I shoot. Run!

But Adam and Serena don't stop.

My car is near here. Come with me.

Where are we going?
To the film set.

Oh no! They're close behind us.
You must drive more quickly.

I've got an idea.
Have you got a mobile phone?
Yes. Why?
Don't ask questions. Dial 0743 2689. Quick!

Please help us.
Where are you?
On the bridge near the airport.
Bring the cameras and film and everything.
Drive to the airport at once. We can stop them there.

This is wonderful. My film can make a lot of money.
Hiccup!

What's happening?
There's no more petrol.

Oh, no. I'm very afraid.

Look, boss. They're stopping.
Let's get them—they've got my money!

What can we do now?
I've got a second idea. Where's the gun?

But—it's a water gun.
Yes, but the thieves don't know.

And it's leaking!

I don't want to be James Bond now.
Oh, no!

Get out of the car. With your hands up.
And the girl. With the rucksack.

I know that voice.

Bring it to me. Slowly!

Is it Mr Smith, my boss?

No, it can't be. He's on holiday.

Don't hurt me, please.

Is the money in the rucksack?
It's our rucksack, boss.

What a lot of money!
Don't be greedy. Leave some for me.

Excellent!

I've got the water gun.
Take the money and leave the girl. I've got a gun, too.

Yes, you have. And it's leaking, Mr Gray.

Mr Smith? But you're on holiday!

Soon. Very soon. With this money I can go on a very long holiday.

Now that you know who I am, I must kill you and your friend.

There are police everywhere. Put your guns down.

This is wonderful. Don't stop filming.

What are you doing?
I can't see anything now!
Ouch!
Stop!
Oh, no!

Now I've got the gun. Listen to the police.

Quick, Adam! Your tie!
What?
Tie his hands.

Mr Gray, you're late for work!
You can get up now, Miss.

I want my money!
Cut! Very good, everybody.

Oh no!

What's the matter?
Mr Smith is right. I am late for work!

HA HA HA!

You're three hours late!
But…
I don't want to hear anything. Leave this bank at once.

But I've got the bank's money.
It's true.

Say 'please'.
Please.

It doesn't matter, Adam. I've got a new job for you. Would you like to be in my film?

Now I'm here, Serena. Nobody can hurt you.

Yes, please!

I want you to be—a bank robber!

HA HA HA

### 语法总结

1. **一般现在时**
   - **用法**：用于表示经常性、习惯性的动作或存在的状态，以及客观事实和普遍真理。在文章中大量使用，描述人物日常状态、工作情况等。
   - **示例**：“Adam Gray works in a bank. He doesn't like his job and he doesn't like Mr Smith, his boss.” 这里 “works” “doesn't like” 都是一般现在时，表明亚当·格雷日常在银行工作，且一直不喜欢他的工作和老板。
2. **一般过去时**
   - **用法**：表示过去某个时间发生的动作或存在的状态。常与表示过去的时间状语连用，如 yesterday, last week 等，但本文更多通过上下文语境体现过去发生的事件。
   - **示例**：故事中描述公园发生抢劫场景、汽车追逐等情节，虽未明确时间状语，但用一般过去时描述动作的发生，如 “Suddenly… What's happening? Help! Stop that! Come on. Run! ” 一系列动作以过去时态展开。
3. **现在进行时**：在文中未直接出现典型的现在进行时结构 “be + 现在分词”，但从整体故事叙述角度，故事在描述当下发生的一系列动态场景，可理解为以类似现在进行的视角展开，增强读者对故事现场感的体验。
4. **祈使句**
   - **用法**：用于表达命令、请求、建议、劝告等语气。
   - **示例**：“Give us the money! ” “Stop that! ” “Move! ” “Don't ask questions. ” “Put your guns down. ” 等，这些祈使句简洁有力地传达了故事中人物的要求或指令。
5. **宾语从句**
   - **用法**：在及物动词或介词后，由一个句子充当宾语。
   - **示例**：“I know that voice, I think. ” 这里 “that voice” 可看作 “know” 的宾语，虽句子结构较简单，但体现了宾语概念；“You don't understand. My name is Serena Silver. I'm an actor. ” 可理解为说话者向对方解释情况，整体内容可视为隐含的宾语（对 “understand” 内容的补充）。
6. **定语从句**：文中未出现典型的 “关系代词/副词 + 从句” 结构的定语从句，但 “his boss” 可看作对 “Mr Smith” 的补充说明，在一定程度上类似后置定语的作用，表明史密斯先生与亚当·格雷的关系。
7. **there be 句型**：“There's no more petrol. ” “There are police everywhere. ” 此句型用于表示 “某处有某物/人”，在文中描述汽车没油和警察出现的场景。
