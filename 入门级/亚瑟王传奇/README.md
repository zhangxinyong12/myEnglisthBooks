# 亚瑟王传奇

## 英文原文

```
It is the year 650 in England. There is no king and people are fighting.
One night Merlin the magician has a dream...
In the morning...
I see a wonderful king. His name is Arthur! How can I find him?
Merlin makes a magic stone. He puts a sword in it. Only the true king can pull out the sword.
You are not the true king.
Shall I try?
You're only a boy!
Try, son! Let's all have a good laugh!
Arthur pulls hard.
Who are you?
What's your name?
Arthur.
Our new king!
But I don't know how to be king.
Suddenly...
Who are you?
Don't be afraid, Arthur! My name is Merlin. With my help you can be king.
The next day many important people come to see Arthur.
He's very young.
Who are those people?
That's your half-sister, Morgan, and her son, Mordred. She can see into the future.
Merlin teaches every day, and after four years he is a strong, good king.
One morning, a soldier visits Arthur.
The lords from the North are coming to fight you.
Go now and fight, Arthur!
Go faster, man!
When they arrive there is a long battle.
Oh, no!
Help!
Hours later most of the other soldiers are dead.
Arthur is King of all England!
We can win every battle now!
Come to my castle. Let's eat and drink all night!
Have some more food everybody!
Ha, ha, ha!
Do you know my daughter Guinevere?
No... it's very nice to meet you.
Arthur and Guinevere talk all evening.
When Arthur comes back...
I want to marry Guinevere.
No... no... Arthur!
I see a dark future for you and Guinevere. Don't marry her!
I am King and I choose my Queen!
Arthur builds the castle of Camelot.
Here's the new castle for my future Queen.
Arthur, I must speak to you...
What's the matter?
I must leave you now. I am losing my magic. Come with me, Arthur.
Looking into the water.
Take the magic sword. You need this for your battles.
Thank you!
Be careful. Don't break it — without your sword you are nothing.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Three weeks later Arthur marries Guinevere.
Good luck!
Two people stand alone... Morgan and her son, Mordred.
I see an unhappy future for Arthur and Guinevere!
Guinevere gives Arthur a large round table.
The strongest knights in England can sit at this table!
I want to find the best knights in the country. Let's have a competition today!
Can I fight first?
Gawain fights many different men. Nobody can beat him.
Is Gawain the strongest knight in England?
No, I am!
Who are you? I can't see your face.
Let's watch him fight. We can see his face later.
Shall I fight in your name, Queen Guinevere?
Yes. Good luck!
Come on, Gawain!
Oh dear!
Oh no!
What's your name?
Lancelot.
Lancelot is the strongest man in all England. He can be the first knight of the Round Table!
Soon, knights come from all over the country. They sit at the Round Table.
Arthur and Guinevere are very happy together.
You're our best friend, Lancelot.
And in the villages...
King Arthur, thank you! We have lots of food to eat.
We have a strong king at last! There is no more fighting.
Guinevere and Lancelot often go riding together.
Look at these beautiful flowers.
One night, Morgan and Mordred arrive at Camelot.
Where is King Arthur?
Hello Morgan! Come in. Would you like to stay?
Yes.
Morgan and Mordred stay for weeks... They are very friendly to Guinevere and Arthur.
What a beautiful castle!
Thank you.
But later...
When I look into the future I see King Arthur is dead. You must be king, my son!
Yes, mother.
One morning Arthur visits Morgan.
Guinevere and I have no son or daughter. Mordred can be king when I die.
Thank you, dear brother. But you are very young...
Be careful, Arthur. Mordred is a bad man.
Arthur tells Guinevere about the dream.
Don't worry. It's only a dream. Morgan and Mordred are nice people.
I can see into the future. There is no Arthur, no castle, and you are king!
Arthur and his knights often ride into the country.
Let's go!
Faster!
They come back with many stories. Guinevere listens excitedly.
Oh Lancelot. You're very strong!
Every evening the knights eat and drink together.
One day Mordred comes to Arthur.
Guinevere and Lancelot are often together.
Yes, of course... Lancelot is my best friend.
What are you saying, Mordred?
Perhaps Guinevere and Lancelot are in love...
Is it ture? Do you love my wife?
Yes, but —
Leave Camelot now, before I kill you.
You don't understand...
Lancelot rides away quickly with some knights.
Guinevere is very unhappy.
And now Arthur does not look after his country.
The magic of the Round Table is dead!
In the towns and villages people begin to fight again.
Everyone is afraid.
You must be a strong king.
Find Lancelot and fight him.
The next day, Arthur leaves with many knights.
Goodbye, King Arthur.
Ha, ha, ha! Bye!
A week later, Arthur and his knights find Lancelot.
Let's fight now! Are you ready?
But I don't want to fight my best friend. Let's talk.
No. There's no more time.
Just then, a soldier arrives from Camelot.
Mordred is now king! Everybody thinks you are dead, and the queen is in prison.
Let's forget our fight! Help me, Lancelot.
Arthur and his knights quickly ride back to Camelot.
Let's find Mordred and kill him!
Mordred's in the next village.
We need to sleep. Let's find him tomorrow.
Do not fight Mordred tomorrow. Lancelot is coming with many soldiers. Wait for him.
Shall we fight Mordred today?
No, Gawain. We must wait. Lancelot and his soldiers are coming.
Arthur and his men meet Mordred.
Hello, old man! Do you want to give me your crown?
You traitor! Where is my wife? I must see her.
You must fight me first!
No... no... not today. Let's fight tomorrow.
Just then, Arthur sees a snake.
Quick. Kill the snake!
Look! We must help Mordred.
Arthur wants to kill him, I think.
Suddenly all of the soldiers start fighting.
What's happening?
Help!
Take that!
They fight for many hours.
No!
Take that!
After three hours...
My knights, my friends, my soldiers... they are all dead!
Gawain... my true friend.
Where's Mordred? I want to kill him!
Die, you traitor!
Ha, ha, ha!
No! My sword...
Goodbye, Arthur!
Help!
Just then, Lancelot and his soldiers arrive.
I'm here now. We can win the battle.
You can't help me now... I'm dying.
Lancelot finds Mordred.
You traitor Mordred!
No...!
Take my sword. Throw it into the water over there!
Lancelot throws the sword.
A hand comes out of the water.
Come with me, Arthur.
Goodbye, Lancelot. Find Guinevere and look after her.
Yes, my lord.
Never forget King Arthur and the magic of the Round Table!

### 故事情节

1. **亚瑟称王**：公元 650 年的英格兰无国王，战乱纷争。魔法师墨林梦到伟大国王亚瑟，他制作魔法石并插入宝剑，只有真国王能拔出。男孩亚瑟成功拔出剑，成为国王。墨林教导亚瑟四年，助其成长为强大的君主。
2. **亚瑟的抉择与发展**：亚瑟打败北方诸侯，巩固统治。他结识吉尼维尔并决定娶她为妻，不顾墨林的警告。亚瑟建造卡米洛城堡，吉尼维尔送他大圆桌，亚瑟通过比赛选拔出兰斯洛特等最强骑士，组建圆桌骑士团，国家繁荣，人们安居乐业。
3. **危机浮现**：摩根和莫德雷德来到卡米洛，起初友好。但摩根预见亚瑟死亡，企图让儿子莫德雷德篡位。莫德雷德向亚瑟进谗言，称吉尼维尔与兰斯洛特相爱，亚瑟怒逐兰斯洛特，此后无心治国，国家再度陷入混乱。
4. **最终对决与悲剧结局**：莫德雷德趁机篡位，亚瑟得知后与骑士返程。找到兰斯洛特时，得知王后入狱。众人赶回卡米洛，亚瑟与莫德雷德约定次日决斗，却因蛇引发意外战斗。最终亚瑟的骑士与士兵战死，亚瑟重伤临死，兰斯洛特赶来，亚瑟让他扔掉宝剑，一只手从水中伸出接走亚瑟，他嘱托兰斯洛特照顾吉尼维尔 。

### 语法要点

1. **一般现在时与一般过去时**：故事主要以一般过去时叙述，描述过去发生的事件，如 “It was the year 650 in England. There was no king and people were fighting.” 。一般现在时偶尔用于直接引语，如人物对话中， “I see a wonderful king.”
2. **情态动词**：
   - “can” 及其过去式 “could” 用于表示能力或可能性，如 “Only the true king can pull out the sword.” （只有真正的国王能拔出剑） 。
   - “must” 表示必要性或义务，如 “I must leave you now. I am losing my magic.” （我现在必须离开你。我正在失去我的魔力） 。
3. **宾语从句**：用于传达人物的想法、言语或信息，如 “I see a dark future for you and Guinevere. Don't marry her!” 中 “a dark future for you and Guinevere” 是 “see” 的宾语 ；“Arthur tells Guinevere about the dream.” 也是常见的主谓宾结构，“the dream” 作宾语。
4. **定语从句**：文中虽未大量出现，但像 “The lords from the North are coming to fight you.” ，“from the North” 可视为对 “The lords” 的后置定语，起到类似定语从句的限定作用。
5. **祈使句**：用于表达命令、请求或建议，如 “Come to my castle. Let's eat and drink all night!” “Kill the snake!” 等 。

### 词汇要点

1. **人物与身份相关**：
   - “magician”（魔法师），如 “Merlin the magician” 。
   - “king”（国王）、“queen”（王后）、“lord”（领主）、“knight”（骑士）、“soldier”（士兵）、“traitor”（叛徒）等，构建起故事的人物阶层体系。
   - “half - sister”（同父异母的姐姐） 。
2. **动作相关**：
   - “pull”（拉、拔），如 “Arthur pulls hard.” 。
   - “fight”（战斗、打仗），常见搭配 “fight against sb.” 或 “fight for sth.”，文中多处出现战斗场景 。
   - “marry”（结婚），“Arthur marries Guinevere.” 。
   - “look after”（照顾），“Find Guinevere and look after her.” 。
3. **其他**：
   - “magic”（魔法；神奇的），形容词 “magical” ，文中围绕魔法石、魔法剑展开情节 。
   - “castle”（城堡） 。
   - “sword”（剑） 。
   - “table”（桌子），文中 “round table”（圆桌） 具有特殊意义 。
